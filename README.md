# LU-Decomposition
LU decomposition of a matrix is the factorization of a given square matrix into two triangular matrices, one upper triangular matrix and one lower triangular matrix, such that the product of these two matrices gives the original matrix. It was introduced by Alan Turing in 1948, who also created the Turing machine.
